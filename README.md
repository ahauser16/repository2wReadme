# repository2wReadme
responsive portfolio website with readme file

This project will be ongoing as I develop my own style and organization.  

I had a question that stumped a bunch of us and TAs.  The nav bar changes its height and text within it when I click from the index page to the portfolio or contact page.  How can I fix this?
